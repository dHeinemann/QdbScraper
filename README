ABOUT
 QdbScraper is a tool for scraping QdbS-powered quote databases (similar
 to Bash.org).  Currently, it successfully scrapes any QdbS installation
 that uses the default theme and/or minimal customization, and saves the
 quotes as individual txt files, named after their quote ID. There are a
 couple of other commonly used QdbS templates, so I'll soon add support
 for those too.

 QdbS itself can be downloaded from www.qdbs.org.  You can easily find
 other QdbS quote databases on the web by Googling for "Powered by
 QdbS", which appears on the bottom of each QdbS page.
